DrupalGap is an open source mobile application development kit for
Drupal websites. This project utilizes Drupal, PhoneGap (Cordova),
and jQueryMobile.

With DrupalGap developers can create custom multi-platform mobile

====

1. Download the latest stable release of DrupalGap:

     https://www.github.com/signalpoint/DrupalGap/tags

2. Extract the downloaded DrupalGap archive into the www directory
   located within your PhoneGap project workspace. When you are done,
   the drupalgap.js file will be located here:

     www/drupalgap.js

   Note, the DrupalGap index.html will overwrite the index.html provided
   by PhoneGap.

3. Open www/app/default.settings.js and save a copy of it as settings.js
   so the copy of it lives here: 
   
     www/app/settings.js
   
4. Specify your Drupal site path (with NO trailing slash) in settings.js,
   for example:

     'site_path':'http://www.drupalgap.org',

5. Run your new Mobile Application!

===================================

From here you'll have a great start to building a mobile application that
integrates with your Drupal website. Check out topics in the Getting
Started Guide to continue.
