### Introduction

This repository contains a PHP SDK that provides access to the [Dropbox REST API][].
The SDK conforms to the [PSR-0 standard][] for autoloading interoperability and requires PHP >= 5.3.1. 
Unless otherwise stated, all components of the SDK are licensed under the [MIT License][].

### Requirements

* PHP >= 5.3.1
* [PHP cURL][] (\Dropbox\OAuth\Consumer\Curl)
* [PHP Mcrypt][] (\Dropbox\OAuth\Storage\Encrypter)
* [PHP PDO][] (\Dropbox\OAuth\Storage\DB)

### Known Issues

* A recent change to the PDO storage handler will require a calling code change or end users will need to re-authorise the application. See [here][PDO handler change] for more information.
* Due to [PHP Bug #48962][] affecting cURL, PHP >= 5.3.1 must be used until further consumers are available

### Usage & Examples

Please see the [examples provided][].
